    <center><h3>What is software Enginering?</h3></center>
  <center>
    <div class="para">


    <p>Software engineers are the people that make the digital world tick. They’re responsible for revolutionary social media apps, like Twitter and Instagram, programming the future of autonomous transportation, robotics and even for this fantastic website you’re reading right now. In short, whenever you’re interacting with a website, app or digital screen, you’re encountering the work of talented software engineers.

Software engineers are, in a nutshell, computer science professionals who use their vast knowledge of engineering principles, methods and languages to create, maintain and update computer software. The software engineering field is very broad, with engineers having various roles and technical expertise. Everything you see on your computer isn’t just magic. It takes a team of highly dedicated engineers, using their varying skills to bring you the information, media or digital experience you want right away.
What sets software engineers apart from most other professions is their flexibility and agility. Whether it’s switching back and forth between different, highly-complicated projects on a daily basis or keeping up with the latest industry technologies and trends, software engineers must stay nimble to provide the best digital experiences possible.

Another trait most successful engineers possess is the ability to effectively communicate. Engineers must work well with a team because projects nowadays involve many different technologies, coding languages and specialties. Most projects are compartmentalized to where each individual engineer works on a certain aspect and then passes it to the next engineer who continues the process. In this case, excellent communication skills are a must to ensure the product gets developed efficiently and works correctly for the user.  </p>

<center><h3>How to become software Engineer?</h3></center>
<center>
<div class="para">


  <p>Truth be told, there isn’t one exact formula to become a software engineer. Sure, a degree in computer science helps you understand the basics of the world of software engineering, but that isn’t the only way to get your foot in the door. Software engineers come from all walks of life, but are all united by one major characteristic: passion. Passion for the industry, the technologies you work on and the product you’re building will propel you to a long, fruitful career as a software engineer. Not only should you be passionate about the code you’re producing, but you should also be passionate about the product you’re working on.

Along with a genuine interest in the field, software engineers must have an innate ability to communicate and act as team players. Everything needs to be communicated precisely so a line of code isn’t written wrong or a design isn’t installed incorrectly. One small miscommunication could result in the breakdown of an entire project. Successful software engineers make it a top priority to constantly sharpen their written and verbal communication skills to be the best asset possible to their team.

How to Become a Software Engineer
What to Look for When Hiring Software Engineers
What are some tangible things aspiring engineers can do to boost their skill set? There are hundreds of bootcamps, hackathons, conferences and networking events that can help you learn valuable skills and meet industry professionals who can help you along your journey to becoming an engineer. These could help you to get a good grasp on what languages you would like to use (Golang, Python, etc.), what type of engineer you want to become (front-end, back-end, etc.) or even what sector you would like to work in. Gaining as much knowledge as possible about the industry and about its varying career paths will help you become a confident software engineer.

What are some other ways to get noticed in the industry? According to industry veterans, one of the best ways to get your name out there is to maintain an active portfolio on open source repositories like Github, Bitbucket, CodePen, etc. This way, you can show off your skills, get inspired by other engineer’s work and find code for your next project. The open source aspect to these sites allows important industry professionals, from engineers to hiring managers, to check your work to make sure you’re the right fit for any project or company.

Software engineers are highly sought-after for a reason. They’re analytical, focused, communicative, knowledgeable and passionate. They’re willing to go above and beyond to do their part in creating the future of technology. Do you have what it takes to tackle some of the biggest technological challenges facing our world today? If so, you might just make the perfect software engineer.</p>
